# Overview  
This project is a page that is hosted on the domain eduardosantos.pt that is my own name. Here I want to promote myself and mainly my jewelry business where I make jewelry from start to finish. I'm a 3D designer aswell.
The goal is to show my clients my page with a high status appeal and also host a 3d viewer where they can see their files anywhere and have an account.
# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- There should be a landing page with my name that promotes me as a high status figure that is going to make their dream project come true.
There is going to be a page with their username, where they can upload files, or me as the admin can upload it to them. I want to give a professional vibe to it. I may even be interested in adding some details to their personal page that only me as the admin can see.
- Why it's important: this page must give me credibility so they are more willing to work with me, so it's going to be used for current and future clients.
I want to give an idea of confidence, trust and intelligence.
- It should be a modern seamless experience, that can showcase myself, work as a client page where they can access files or allow me to send them a link with their 3d project to quickly see if they are liking it and make it professional at the same time and unique.]

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- Some users will be just people I show my page and are not clients yet and are curious about what I do. Here they will be able to see quickly what I do and be amazed by the page and work as a greeting card.
Other users will be current clients who will have a personalized page, where they can upload or see 3d files of their projects. This way they can see different versions and pick.
I'm open to new ideas for users.
- THey can quickly login, see their files, maybe even see the stage of the product and where were at like design, manufacture, casting etc. if I want to allow them to see as an admin. And thus giving them an unique experience.

- The UI should be very very modern and intuitive, and not too full or complicated and must open on mobile and desktop]

# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- For now I'm using Supabase to host the 3d files and I'm uploading the maincode to github.
- Data models
- A lot of Rhino3dm is used, along with other 3Dviewers as reference like the "Reference3dviewer" inside the project. The goal is to open most types of files.
- Later on I might need better infrastructure, but for now I'm gonna use Supabase though I'm open to free suggestions]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- A great front page, a fast and working 3D viewer that can open .3dm .obj .stl and later solidworks files. A great file management system that also allows the admin account to make changes to other users.
- Making a very powerful render engine capable of rendering very realistically the 3d pieces. Later on even allowing clients to pick diamonds shapes and sizes for their projects. Maybe even an AI helper that is not very "chatbot" looking but that will fundamentally work as one and help their doubts and my conversion.
I'm open to new ambitious ideas too.
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation): the main landing page and working modern 3d viewer and file system
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]
the 3d viewer should be simple for the user and allow them to see the piece in various kinds of metals realistically and also have some fast render mode for bad connections. It should render diamonds and allow you to switch from diamonds to emeralds rubis or some other stone so they can pick what they like best.
the main page must subtly make me a high value individual that gives a trust feeling. I don't intend to fill the main page with projects, it should have a clean look.

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges: the 3d render engine might be hard to not be slow with some files, and rendering the gems might be tough if it's realtime.
I'm not quite sure how to make the website look ahead of the competition, I want it very innovative and unique but I don't know exactly how. Usually I say for the UI to be apple style, but I can't describe precisely much more.
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon; I think a dashing front page and 3d viewer can be intactful. But I'm open to new ideas.
- For the client files there's a temporary 50mb upload for supabase. If things go well I can pay for more. For now I want to make it work at this limit of upload.]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- There's a refrence3dviewer github that is also downloaded in a project folder that is good at opening many types of files.

- Technical specifications]
